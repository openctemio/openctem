# SIEM ingest → CTEM Detect/Respond

How a SIEM/EDR/XDR (Splunk, Sentinel, CrowdStrike, …) pushes detections **into**
OpenCTEM so they close the CTEM Stage-4 Detect/Respond loop: a runtime detection
that matches a known indicator auto-reopens the finding it came from.

This is the **inbound** direction. For the **outbound** direction (OpenCTEM
findings → Splunk HEC) see the Splunk notification provider.

## Design: the SIEM is a collector, not a new endpoint

OpenCTEM already has a proven, tenant-isolated runtime-telemetry ingest path:

```
POST /api/v1/telemetry-events   (agent API-key auth, per-tenant rate limited)
        │  batch of runtime events
        ▼
runtime_telemetry_events  ──►  IOC Correlator  ──►  auto-reopen source finding
        (migration 000155)      (matches indicator     (ReopenForIOCMatch,
                                 values in properties)   audit-logged)
```

Rather than build a second, separate ingest endpoint (more attack surface, a new
auth path, duplicated tenant-scoping), a SIEM forwarder authenticates as a
**collector agent** — an agent whose capability is `collect` — and posts to the
same endpoint. An external data source is then just another authenticated
collector, and it reuses the security controls that path already enforces:

- tenant is taken from the agent's identity, **never** from the request body — a
  compromised forwarder cannot write into another tenant;
- per-tenant rate limiting;
- the same IOC correlation + auto-reopen the agent EDR/XDR stream uses.

## Setup

1. Register a platform agent for the SIEM forwarder (a bootstrap token, or an
   API key). Give it a recognizable name, e.g. `splunk-forwarder`.
2. Configure the SIEM's alert action / webhook to `POST /api/v1/telemetry-events`
   with header `X-API-Key: <agent key>` and the JSON body below.

## Payload

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "event_type": "siem_detection",
      "severity": "high",
      "observed_at": "2026-08-30T12:00:00Z",
      "correlation_id": "<optional: the validation command id this reacts to>",
      "properties": {
        "remote_ip": "203.0.113.10",
        "remote_domain": "malicious.example.com",
        "file_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb924...",
        "rule": "Splunk: Known-bad C2 beacon",
        "raw_ref": "https://splunk/app/search/…"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`event_type` accepts `siem_detection`, `edr_alert`, `ioc_match` (added in
migration 000216) alongside the endpoint-agent types; up to 100 events per POST.

### Indicator mapping (this is what drives auto-reopen)

The correlator extracts candidate indicator values from **specific property
keys** and matches them against the tenant's active IOC catalogue. Map the SIEM's
detection fields onto these keys or correlation will not fire:

| Indicator | property key(s) |
|-----------|-----------------|
| IP        | `remote_ip`, `source_ip` |
| Domain    | `remote_domain`, `query_name` |
| URL       | `remote_url`, `url` |
| File hash | `file_hash`, `image_hash` |

Any other fields (`rule`, `raw_ref`, …) are stored on the event for context but
are not correlated.

## What happens on a match

For each indicator hit, the correlator records an `ioc_matches` row and, if the
indicator carries a `source_finding_id`, calls `ReopenForIOCMatch` — the finding
is reopened with reason `ioc auto-reopen: runtime match on <type>=<value>` and an
audit event is written, so an analyst can answer "why did this reopen?".

## Notes / limits

- Events without an `endpoint_asset_id` still correlate (matching keys on values,
  not asset), but are invisible to per-asset dashboards. A forwarder reports on
  many hosts, so this is expected for SIEM data.
- Populate the tenant IOC catalogue (with `source_finding_id` where known) for
  the loop to have anything to match against.
