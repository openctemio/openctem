## Problem

Cover a large estate (e.g. 3000 IPs) with a scanner licensed for fewer active
IPs (e.g. 500), by scanning in rolling, license-sized batches and storing every
result durably in OpenCTEM — **without** wrongly resolving findings for assets
that were not in the current batch.

OpenCTEM is the **system of record** for the full estate; the scanner holds at
most one batch at a time.

## Engines (both first-class)

| Engine | License unit | Reclaim | Rotation |
|--------|--------------|---------|----------|
| **Nessus Professional** | per scanner, **unlimited IPs** | n/a | not needed — batch = perf/time only |
| **Tenable.sc** | **active IPs** (cap) | explicit removal (immediate) + repo aging | first-class — scheduler enforces the cap |
| *(Tenable.io, ref)* | assets, 90-day count | deletion lag ~90d | excluded — can't reclaim in time |

A single `ScanEngine` interface with a per-engine `LicensePolicy`
(`Unlimited` vs `ActiveIPCap` + `Reclaim`) lets the scheduler treat both
identically: it reads the policy to size batches and decide whether a reclaim
step runs.

## End-to-end flow

```
   estate (all assets, Criticality + LastScannedAt)
            │  coverage rotation: order by (criticality DESC, LastScannedAt ASC)
            ▼
   select next batch (size = license headroom, e.g. 500)
            │
            ▼
   ScanEngine.Launch(targets) ─poll─► Export(.nessus)
            │
            ▼
   nessus.Convert(.nessus)  ──►  *ctis.Report   (internal/infra/scanner/nessus)
            │   tool=tenable · metadata.id=session · coverage=full · synthetic default branch
            ▼
   ingest pipeline (RFC-005 async)
            │   AutoResolveStaleByAssets(tenant, assetIDs=BATCH, tool, scanID)
            ▼
   findings stored + stale-resolved ONLY within the batch
            │
            ▼
   set LastScannedAt(batch); (.sc) Reclaim(batch) gated on ingest ACK; advance cursor
```

## The safety invariant (most important property)

Each batch covers only N of the estate. Auto-resolve **must** touch only the
batch's assets. This is **already enforced** by the ingest pipeline: it calls
`AutoResolveStaleByAssets(tenantID, assetIDs, toolName, scanID, branchID)`
scoped to **(this tool) × (these asset IDs) × (this scan)**
(`internal/app/ingest/service.go`). So:

- a 500-IP batch cannot resolve the other 2500 assets' findings;
- a Tenable scan cannot resolve agent-scanner (nuclei/trivy) findings.

The requirement on the converter is therefore narrow: emit **one report per
batch** with `tool.name="tenable"`, a unique `metadata.id` (the scan session),
`coverage_type="full"`, and only that batch's hosts.

> **Not working today (verified 2026-10):** ingest's auto-resolve requires a
> default branch, built for CI/SAST scans. The converter emits a **synthetic**
> `Branch{IsDefaultBranch:true}` to pass the report-level gate, but branches are
> only tracked for repository assets and the auto-resolve query joins findings
> to the repository's default branch, so host findings (`branch_id` NULL) are
> never matched. Uploading a batch that no longer contains a finding leaves it
> open. Non-repository findings do not auto-resolve by design (see
> `shift-left-ci-scanning.md`, "Which findings auto-resolve"); making this one
> server-side, batch-scoped path an exception is an open product decision.

## `.nessus → CTIS` converter (shipped, #139)

`internal/infra/scanner/nessus/converter.go` — `Convert(io.Reader, ConvertOptions) (*ctis.Report, error)`.
Both Nessus Pro and Tenable.sc emit the same `NessusClientData_v2` format, so one
converter serves both.

- `ReportHost` → CTIS asset (host/ip_address; FQDN preferred value; ip/os/mac/fqdn in properties).
- `ReportItem` → CTIS vulnerability finding:
  - severity 0–4 → info/low/medium/high/critical;
  - CVSS (v3 preferred over v2), remediation from `solution`, `see_also` → references;
  - first-class CTIS fields (no longer stuffed in `properties`): `vulnerability.cve_ids`
    (all CVEs per plugin) + `cve_id` (primary), `vpr_score` (Tenable VPR),
    `exploit_available`, `cpe`; `finding.network` {port, protocol, service};
    `finding.evidence` (plugin_output);
  - stable fingerprint `nessus:<host>:<plugin>:<port>/<proto>` for cross-cycle dedup.
- `ConvertOptions`: `ScanSessionID` (→ metadata.id, unique per batch), `ToolName`
  (default `tenable`), `MinSeverity` (drop info noise), `Now` (deterministic tests),
  `DefaultCriticality`.

## Manual / cron ingest endpoint (shipped)

Until the live Tenable connector lands, results enter OpenCTEM by uploading a
`.nessus` export. This is the RFC's Phase 1 pilot path (an external script or
operator pushes each batch's file):

```
POST /api/v1/assets/import/nessus-findings        (JWT; AssetsWrite + FindingsWrite)
  ?session_id=<batch id>   optional — unique per batch (default: generated)
  ?tool=tenable            optional — auto-resolve scope (default: tenable)
  ?min_severity=1          optional — 0..4, drop info noise (default: 1)
  body: the .nessus XML
  → { "scan_session_id": "...", "result": { assets_*, findings_*, findings_auto_resolved, ... } }
```

Each upload is one batch: the handler builds a synthetic agent for the tenant
(mirroring the ingest job processor), runs `nessus.Convert`, and ingests through
the standard pipeline. The report is shaped for batch-scoped auto-resolve
(tool, session id, full coverage), but host findings are not auto-resolved
today; see the note above. Contrast with
`POST /api/v1/assets/import/nessus`, which imports host assets only (no findings).
Handler: `internal/infra/http/handler/asset_import_handler.go` `IngestNessusFindings`.

## Reused infrastructure (do not rebuild)

| Need | Existing primitive |
|------|--------------------|
| Batch size, scheduling, retry, timeout | `pkg/domain/scan` — `Scan.TargetsPerJob`, scheduler, retry/backoff |
| Durable findings + dedup/correlation/idempotency | `internal/app/ingest` (RFC-005 async) |
| Batch-scoped stale resolution | `FindingRepository.AutoResolveStaleByAssets` |
| Rotation cursor | `asset` `Criticality` + `LastScannedAt` |
| Per-tenant credentials | `integration` `ProviderTenable` + AES-256-GCM creds (mirror Jira resolver) |

## Tenable.sc active-IP accounting

Use a dedicated rotation repository; `Reclaim` = **explicit removal** of the
just-ingested batch's IPs (frees the count immediately on `.sc`, unlike `.io`),
with short repo data-expiration as a passive backstop. The scheduler tracks the
`active_ip_set` itself (doesn't trust instant reclaim), so a slow removal delays
the next launch instead of breaching the cap.

## Two execution modes (both first-class)

A Tenable integration runs in one of two selectable modes (`config.execution_mode`),
sharing everything above the execution boundary — scheduler, parser, ingest,
mappings, isolation. Only *where the Tenable REST calls run* differs:

- **`direct`** — the backend calls Tenable REST itself (cloud, or reachable `.sc`).
  api-side `DirectRunner` + per-tenant resolver. **No agent/sdk-go work.**
- **`agent`** — a purpose-built agent on the customer network calls the local
  appliance and pushes CTIS back (on-prem `.sc` the api can't reach). Adds an agent
  `tenable` tool + a shared `TenableClient`/parser; api-side `AgentRunner` dispatches
  the job carrying the coverage `session_id`. Credentials can stay **agent-local**
  (api never holds on-prem creds).

The two modes share the L1 `TenableClient` (REST, injectable HTTP) and the L2
`.nessus → CTIS` parser; only the thin `ScanEngineRunner` strategy differs. The
parser is promoted to the shared `ctis` module so api and agent use one copy.
Full design + code-ownership + tenant-isolation in
[RFC-007 §3.9](../rfcs/RFC-007-license-aware-scan-coverage.md).

Today (Phase 1): on-prem unreachable from the api is already covered by an external
cron pushing `.nessus` to `POST /assets/import/nessus-findings` — no agent needed yet.

### Configuring a Tenable integration (shipped)

A `provider=tenable` integration carries `config.execution_mode` (`agent` default |
`direct`) and `config.engine` (`nessus_pro` default | `tenable_sc`). Creation is
validated server-side (`internal/app/scancoverage/tenable_config.go`):

- **agent mode MUST NOT store credentials in the control plane** (RFC-007 §8 R3/R4)
  — they belong on the runner; supplying credentials is rejected.
- **direct mode requires credentials + base_url** (the api calls Tenable).
- unknown `execution_mode`/`engine` values are rejected; config is normalized so the
  stored record always carries explicit values.

The create-integration endpoint now accepts a `config` object to set these.

### Automatic rolling coverage (Phase 3, shipped — unlimited engine)

Set these extra `config` keys on a `provider=tenable` integration to opt it into
automatic, license-aware rolling coverage:

| Key | Meaning | Default |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `coverage_enabled` | Opt into auto-rotation (off → integration is just a connection) | `false` |
| `batch_size` | Per-cycle batch (perf/time window) | `256` |
| `agent_id` | Pin a specific runner (C3); omit → capability routing | — |
| `template_uuid` | Override the runner's Nessus template | — |
| `license_cap` / `safety_margin` | Active-IP cap for `tenable_sc` | — |

The **coverage scheduler** (`internal/infra/controller/coverage_scheduler.go`) runs
every 5 minutes: it lists coverage-enabled Tenable integrations cross-tenant, sizes a
batch against the engine's license headroom (`internal/app/scancoverage/scheduler.go`
→ `planner.go`), dispatches it to a runner
(`internal/app/scancoverage/dispatcher.go` → a `scan` command with `scanner=tenable`),
and advances the rotation cursor (`scan_coverage_state`, migration 000176) so the same
assets sort last next cycle. The runner scans its local appliance and pushes CTIS back;
ingest auto-resolve is scoped to the batch's `session_id` + assets.

Every batch passes the checks of a scan trigger before it is claimed
(`scan.Service.ResolveDispatchTargets`, RFC-042 F16): scan create's target
validator (a private address only inside a scan zone; loopback, link-local and
metadata never), approved scope exclusions, the attribution of the candidate
asset (an asset whose ownership is not confirmed is skipped, RFC-036 O4), and
zone routing ([active-probe-gate.md](active-probe-gate.md)). A skipped asset
is claimed without a dispatch, so it rotates to the back and is checked again
on its next turn. A batch stays in the zone of its top candidate, the command
is stamped with that zone, and a pinned sensor must be in it. No gate, or a
failed exclusion or attribution lookup, dispatches nothing. Internal networks therefore need
a scan zone covering them, as for any other scan.

> **Scope:** today the scheduler drives only **unlimited engines (Nessus Pro)** —
> exactly the 3000-IP-on-Nessus-Pro use case. **Capped engines (Tenable.sc) are
> skipped** (logged) until active-IP accounting + reclaim-ACK ship (Phase 3.5):
> dispatching them without that accounting could exceed the license, which the
> scheduler refuses to risk.

## Roadmap (RFC-007)

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | `.nessus → CTIS` findings adapter + batch-scoped safety + manual ingest endpoint | **Done** — converter (#139) + `POST /assets/import/nessus-findings` |
| 2 | `ScanEngine` connector (Nessus Pro + Tenable.sc) + runner executor | **Done (mock-first)** — sdk-go tenable client/parser, agent `TenableExecutor`; live-appliance REST verification pending |
| 3 | Coverage scheduler (rotation cursor, dispatch, license headroom) | **Done (unlimited engine)** — planner + dispatcher + scheduler + live controller + `scan_coverage_state` |
| 3.5 | `.sc` active-IP accounting + reclaim gated on ingest ACK | Planned |
| 4 | Observability (freshness, coverage %) | **Done (API)** — `GET /api/v1/scans/coverage`; UI pending |

### Coverage observability (Phase 4, shipped — API)

`GET /api/v1/scans/coverage?window_days=30` (JWT; `scans:read`) returns a
tenant-scoped coverage summary so rolling scans become *verifiable*:

```json
{
  "window_days": 30, "total_scannable": 3000, "never_scanned": 500,
  "covered_in_window": 2400, "stale": 100,
  "critical_never_scanned": 3, "critical_uncovered": 5,
  "oldest_dispatched_at": "2026-05-02T...", "coverage_percent": 80.0
}
```

Computed by `ScanCoverageRepository.CoverageStats` (one conditional-aggregation
query over the scannable estate LEFT JOIN `scan_coverage_state`). `coverage_percent`
= covered-in-window / total. The headline risk metric is `critical_never_scanned`.
