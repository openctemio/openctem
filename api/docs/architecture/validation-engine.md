## What "Validation" means here

CTEM Stage-4 answers: *did the fix actually hold, and is the exposure really
gone?* Instead of trusting a status change, OpenCTEM records **Evidence** — the
result of re-running a technique against the finding's target — and moves the
finding accordingly.

| Routes | `internal/infra/http/routes/validation.go` |

### Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/validation/evidence` — **agent API-key auth.** An agent submits
  the result of a validation/proof-of-fix run for a finding. The tenant is taken
  from the authenticated agent (`AgentFromContext`), **never** the body, so a
  compromised agent cannot write into another tenant. Returns `202 Accepted`
  with the evidence id and whether the finding's status changed.

  Body:
  ```json
  {
    "finding_id": "<uuid>",
    "executor_kind": "safe-check",
    "technique": "T1046",
    "outcome": "not_detected",
    "summary": "exposure no longer reproduces",
    "target": { "type": "web_url", "address": "https://..." },
    "simulation_run_id": "<uuid?>",
    "artifacts": ["<attachment-id>"],
    "raw_meta": { }
  }
  ```

- `GET /api/v1/findings/{id}/evidence` — **JWT auth, `findings:read`.** Lists the
  evidence recorded for a finding (newest first) for the finding detail page.

### Guarantees

- **Tenant isolation** — evidence is scoped to the agent's tenant; the finding
  must exist *within that tenant* before any evidence is recorded (guards
  against cross-tenant finding ids that the FK alone would not catch).
- **Secret redaction** — `Summary` and `RawMeta` stdout/stderr are scrubbed for
  common secret patterns before persistence (defence-in-depth; the agent should
  not capture secrets, but Atomic Red Team stdout can).
- **Evidence is the source of truth** — it is always persisted; if the finding
  cannot legally transition from its current state (e.g. already closed) that is
  logged but not fatal, and the recorded evidence still surfaces.
- **Outcome mapping has one home** — `applyOutcomeToFinding` is shared by the
  ingest path and the `ProofOfFixService.Retest` (dispatch) path.

## Dispatch (producer side) — RFC-011 MVP

The ingest side above records evidence that arrives "out of band". RFC-011 adds
the **producer**: an operator (or automation) can *ask* for a validation run,
and the result flows back through the same ingest path — no new agent HTTP
surface.

```
POST /api/v1/findings/{id}/validate  (JWT, findings:write)
      │  RunService.ValidateFinding: resolve finding → asset → Target,
      │  Selector picks safe-check, build ValidationJob
      ▼
CommandDispatcher → command (type=validate, tenant-scoped) → agent poll queue
      │  agent runs the safe-check probe, reports {outcome,summary} on
      │  POST /agent/commands/{id}/complete
      ▼
CommandHandler.Complete → triggerValidationEvidence(cmd)
      │  maps result → Evidence, tenant taken from the COMMAND (authoritative)
      ▼
EvidenceIngestService.Ingest → persist (redacted) + reconcile finding status
```

| Piece | Where |
|-------|-------|
| `validate` command type | `pkg/domain/command/entity.go` (`CommandTypeValidate`), migration `000184_command_type_validate` |
| Async dispatcher (job → command) | `internal/app/validation/dispatcher.go` (`CommandDispatcher`) |
| Producer service (finding → job) | `internal/app/validation/run.go` (`RunService.ValidateFinding`) |
| Producer endpoint | `POST /api/v1/findings/{id}/validate` (`FindingActionsHandler.RequestValidation`) |
| Result → evidence hook | `internal/infra/http/handler/command_handler.go` (`triggerValidationEvidence`) |

**Why the completion hook, not a direct agent POST to `/validation/evidence`:**
that endpoint requires a *tenant* agent (takes tenant from the agent). Routing
the result through the command-completion hook lets the tenant come from the
**command** — the single authoritative source — and reuses the wired
poll/ack/start/complete queue instead of the not-yet-wired platform-job
transport.

**Executor kinds:** the original round-1 scope was only the `safe-check` kind
(non-intrusive TCP/TLS/HTTP reachability re-check, technique `T1046`).
**RFC-011.2 Phase 2b has since shipped the API side of the `nuclei` re-verify
kind** (`KindNuclei`, `internal/app/validation/executor.go`): the selector routes
a finding to a nuclei re-check when its detection signature can be safely re-run,
builds the detection signature the agent needs, and **refuses signatures that map
to a destructive/non-detection template class** (`nuclei_routing.go` mirrors the
agent-side `-exclude-tags dos,fuzz,intrusive` allowlist so the two ends can't
drift; technique `T1190`). The API remains a pure orchestrator — it never runs
nuclei. `Selector`/`DefaultSelector` prefer safe-check and gate the riskier kinds
behind an attacker profile.

**Active-probe gate:** `CommandDispatcher` is the only producer of validate
commands, and every job passes the scan target gate before a command exists:
scope exclusions, the private-range policy, the asset attribution and scan-zone
routing (a zoned target is pinned to its zone). A refusal is
`validation.ErrTargetRefused` (400 with the reason); an unwired gate or a lookup
error dispatches nothing. See [active-probe-gate.md](active-probe-gate.md).

**Evidence ownership:** evidence that cites its validate command takes the
simulation run and the asset from that command; a body naming another run or
asset is refused (403). Advisory evidence (no command) cannot cite a
simulation run, and evidence may name only its finding's asset.

**Capability gate:** dispatch routes a job to an agent by matching the job's
required capability against the agent's flat capability list. A `safe-check`
job requires `validate`; a `KindNuclei` job requires the deeper `validate:nuclei`
capability, so a nuclei re-check is only ever dispatched to an agent that
advertises it. Both strings are the single source of truth in
`internal/app/validation/dispatcher.go` (`AgentCapabilityValidate` /
`AgentCapabilityValidateNuclei`).

## Which evidence may move a finding (RFC-039 D3, 2026-10-03)

Only an **exploitability-grade** result reaches the verdict table below
(`actionableVerdict` in `internal/app/validation/verdict.go`):

- A **safe-check** (reachability probe) never moves a finding and stamps no
  verdict. "Port open" is not "fix did not hold", "connection refused" is not
  "fix stood". Its evidence stays visible (the web labels it *Reachable* /
  *Not reachable*).
- A **nuclei / BAS** run that **matched** is `reproducible`, as before.
- A run that did **not** match counts only when its evidence says the target
  answered (`raw_meta.reachable == true`). nuclei prints nothing and exits 0
  for a host that does not answer, so a bare `not_detected` is *unknown, never
  fixed*. Today's sensor does not send `reachable`, so in practice `/validate`
  confirms an issue is still there but never closes one: closing on a clean
  re-run is the job of a **retest**, which proves reachability with its own
  probe ([continuous-retest.md](continuous-retest.md)).

Proof of fix on `fix_applied` now goes through `retest.ProofOfFix`: a nuclei
finding gets a proof-of-fix retest; any other finding falls back to this
validation re-check.

## Confirm-or-downgrade verdict + downgrade % (RFC-011.2 Phase 2a)

When a validation result is ingested, the status-reconciliation step
(`applyOutcomeToFinding`, shared by the evidence-ingest and proof-of-fix paths)
turns the execution `Outcome` into a finding-level **verdict** and moves the
finding:

| Verdict (outcome) | Finding before | Transition |
|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| `not_reproducible` (`not_detected`) | new / confirmed / in_progress | → `validated_fixed` (**downgrade**, `downgraded_at` stamped) |
| `not_reproducible` | `fix_applied` | → `resolved` (verified proof-of-fix, *not* a downgrade) |
| `reproducible` (`detected`) | `fix_applied` | → `in_progress` (fix did not hold) + notify |
| `reproducible` | `validated_fixed` | → `confirmed` (prior downgrade refuted) |
| `reproducible` | other open | hold, stamp "still exploitable" |
| inconclusive / error / skipped | any | no change |

`validated_fixed` is a new **in_progress-category** state: de-prioritized but
**not closed** — the conservative default is that a human still closes it
(`validated_fixed → resolved` requires `findings:verify`). A non-intrusive
re-check never auto-closes a live finding.

The verdict is persisted on the finding by a `VerdictRecorder`
(`findings.validation_outcome` + `downgraded_at`, migration `000209`), a narrow
side-write next to the status transition. This makes the CTEM **downgrade %**
outcome metric real: `GET /api/v1/validation/coverage` now returns `downgraded`,
`downgrade_validated`, and `downgrade_pct` (`validation.DowngradePct`), so the
Program-Health board's "not measured" blank can go live (ui = Phase 2c).

Since RFC-039 D3 the rule no longer acts on a `safe-check` result (see above). Phase 2b (now shipped API-side) deepens the
*depth* of the result by adding the capability-gated `nuclei` re-verify kind
described above; the only remaining Phase 2b gap is the **agent-side executor**
(see "Not yet shipped" below).

## Not yet shipped (deferred)

- **Agent-side executor** — the API enqueues `validate` commands, but the agent
  binary does not yet execute them (the tenant-runner uses `sdk-go/pkg/core`
  with a fixed command-type switch; adding `validate` there is a follow-up
  sdk-go release + agent bump). Until then the loop is driven by the E2E harness
  / any client that completes the command with an outcome.
- **Synchronous dispatcher** — `ValidationDispatcher`/`ProofOfFixService.Retest`
  (block for the agent's reply) remain unused; the async producer above is the
  functional path.
- **Pentest retest wiring** — `POST /pentest/findings/{id}/retests` does not yet
  call the ingest/proof-of-fix path.
- **Coverage SLO enforcement** at cycle-close (`coverage.go` exists, not gated).
- **`AgentCapability` production impl** (executor-kind discovery from agent
  registrations).
