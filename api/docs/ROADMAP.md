# OpenCTEM — Project Assessment & Roadmap

> Living strategic doc: where the platform stands, where it's strong, and the
> prioritized work to make it best-in-class. Updated 2026-07-03.

## 1. What OpenCTEM is

A multi-tenant **CTEM** (Continuous Threat Exposure Management) platform that
operationalizes AppSec across the SDLC. The sidebar mirrors the five CTEM phases:
**Scoping → Discovery → Prioritization → Validation → Mobilization**. The
differentiator vs. a plain scanner: *correlate + dedup → business-context
prioritize → validate → mobilize*, not just "list findings".

## 2. Honest assessment — strengths (verified)

Three rounds of cross-repo deep-dive back these up:

- **Multi-tenant isolation** is correct end-to-end (`WHERE tenant_id` everywhere;
  cache keys tenant-scoped; ingest tenant from the authenticated agent).
- **Risk prioritization** beyond severity: EPSS + CISA-KEV + VPR + reachability +
  asset criticality. Most scanners stop at severity.
- **Shift-left agent**: multi-scanner, risk-aware gate, idempotent PR/MR comments + sticky summary, **new-vs-base** PR scoping.
- **Mobilization**: bidirectional Jira sync (create + inbound + outbound status,
  opt-in, echo-safe), per-tenant configurable status maps.
- **Validation** is now real (RFC-011): `POST /findings/{id}/validate` dispatches
  a non-intrusive safe-check platform job → agent probe → result mapped to
  validation evidence → finding status reconciliation + coverage KPI. The "V" in
  CTEM is no longer a fake in-process heuristic.
- **Enterprise SSO**: SAML SP-initiated login + ACS (signature/condition/replay
  validated), SCIM user+group provisioning, and EntraID OIDC id_token/nonce
  verification all shipped (RFC-009).
- **Reliability**: transactional outbox + asynq queues, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`,
  audit hash-chain, paired migrations, preflight-migrate gate.
- **Code-level security**: across ~9 reviewer-passes only ~8 genuine bugs surfaced
  (all fixed); auth/JWT/permission swept clean. The base is solid.

## 3. Honest assessment — gaps (where value is thin)

The engine is strong; the **operator/management layer** that customers see weekly
is thin:

- **Reporting**: scheduler controller runs `ListDue()` end-to-end (#177) and PDF
  export shipped (`pkg/report/pdf.go`); remaining gap is technical/compliance
  report generators + KEV/EPSS/SLA breakdown in the digest.
  *(Core scheduler + PDF done — see Tier 1.)*
- **Remediation workflow**: ✅ shipped — first-class *remediation campaigns*
  (group findings → owner → deadline → progress) now exist (RFC-015; see Tier 1).
  Remaining gap is deeper bidirectional Jira sync of campaign progress.
- **Ticketing breadth**: Jira only (provider abstraction exists, unused).
- **Enterprise table-stakes**: SSO/SAML/SCIM now shipped (RFC-009); the remaining
  gap is i18n — framing exists (en/vi/ar direction) but no translation layer wired.
- Operational debt: `.sc` active-IP accounting deferred; live Nessus REST only
  mock-verified; dependency drift between develop/main (self-healing via
  retargeted dependabot).

## 4. Prioritized roadmap

Ordered by value-to-effort. Tier 1 builds entirely on existing infra (no new
infrastructure, no product unknowns).

### Tier 1 — finish what's promised (highest ROI)

1. **Report scheduler + weekly digest** ✅ *(core shipped)* — `report_schedules`
   now execute. Pieces delivered: generic exec-summary generator
   (`pkg/report.GenerateSummaryHTML`, #175) → `ReportScheduler` controller polling
   `ListDue` + rendering + email delivery + `RecordRun` + next-run via
   `robfig/cron` (#177), plus PDF export (`pkg/report/pdf.go`). *Remaining polish:*
   technical/compliance report generators, KEV/EPSS/SLA breakdown in the digest
   (needs extra queries — `FindingStats` has no KEV/EPSS fields today).
2. **Remediation Campaigns** ✅ *(shipped, RFC-015)* — group N findings into a
   campaign with owner / deadline / progress. Delivered: `remediation_campaigns`
   (migration 000125) + ticket linkage (000177), the app service
   (`internal/app/exposure/remediation_campaign.go`), handler
   (`remediation_campaign_handler.go`), campaign RBAC middleware
   (`middleware/campaign_rbac.go`), and the Postgres repository. Completes the
   Mobilization pillar. *Remaining polish:* deeper bidirectional Jira sync via the
   `WorkItem` seam designed in RFC-006 Phase 3e.
3. **Risk-posture trending** ✅ *(already shipped)* — `risk_snapshots` table
   (migration 000145), `RiskSnapshotController` (registered in `workers.go`, 6h
   interval), `GET /dashboard/risk-trend` + `/velocity` endpoints, and UI trend
   charts already exist. No further work required beyond surfacing the series in
   scheduled reports (see #1 polish).

### Tier 2 — broaden reach

4. **GitHub Issues as a 2nd ticket provider** — cheap (the `TicketProvider`
   interface exists), large audience, validates the abstraction.
5. **Agent auto-fix PRs** — for SCA findings with a fixed version, the agent opens
   a dependency-bump PR, closing the loop from finding to fix in the developer's
   workflow.
6. **Finish RFC-007** — `.sc` active-IP accounting + live-appliance Nessus REST
   verification (needs real hardware).

### Tier 3 — commercial foundation

7. **SSO / SAML** ✅ *(shipped, RFC-009)* — SAML SP login + ACS, SCIM
   provisioning, EntraID OIDC id_token/nonce verification. Enterprise
   procurement table-stakes now met.
8. **i18n translation layer** — the direction/RTL scaffold exists; wire a real
   string catalog (notably for the vi market).
9. **Compliance packs** — map findings → ISO 27001 / PCI / SOC2 controls
   (compliance finding-type already exists) → audit-ready evidence.

### Attack-surface UI and run-observability backlog

Carried over from a 2026-07 source-level review of the scan and inventory
surfaces. Status was not re-verified when this list moved here; check the code
before scheduling an item.

- **Surface what we already store:** tags and scanned-by columns on findings;
  worker count and an explicit "unrunnable" state on the tools grid; supported
  tools on the worker card; "View full page" from the asset sheet; a
  `/settings/ai` page for the AI fields already mapped; geo/ASN columns and a
  country rollup; a decomposed CVSS panel (the metric dictionary already exists
  in `cvss-calculator.tsx`).
- **Certificate expiry:** a partial btree on
  `((properties->'certificate'->>'not_after'))` where `asset_type='certificate'`
  (all writers emit RFC3339 UTC, so lexical order is chronological and no
  non-IMMUTABLE cast is needed), then `?expiring_within=30d`, sort by expiry,
  dashboard tiles and a days-left badge on rows.
- **Run observability:** a run-detail route (pipeline strip, per-step rows,
  error panel); `step_runs.output` in the DTO; keep failure detail
  (`DurationMs`/`ExitCode`/`Metadata`) instead of only `error_message`; write
  `tool_executions` at dispatch and on result, one row per (step × asset).
- **Change feed:** `exposure_events` producers from an ingest-time property diff
  and a scheduled pass over `not_after`; recon deltas recorded in
  `asset_state_history` rather than a separate probe-history table.
- **Pipelines:** feed step N's output into step N+1 by resolving targets from the
  asset graph, filtered by the step tool's `supported_targets`, with server-side
  scope/SSRF validation of the injected targets and a per-job cap; register or
  trim the preset tools that have no `tools` row; collapse the scan dispatch
  paths into one.
- **New surfaces (scoped separately):** global data search (needs an API
  route); asset screenshots; one filter bar shared across asset pivots that
  keeps filters when switching tab; a technology catalogue; JSON-Schema-driven
  integration connect forms.
- **Non-goals:** tenancy reached through joins instead of a `tenant_id` column;
  fingerprints without a tenant column; live geo lookup per page load; full HTTP
  response bodies stored per probe; linear-only chains; shell-command tool
  templates.

## 5. Recommendation

All three Tier-1 items — #1 (report scheduler), #2 (remediation campaigns), and
#3 (risk trending) — have now shipped, so the Mobilization pillar is complete.
The next highest-ROI work is **Tier 2**: GitHub Issues as a 2nd ticket provider
and agent auto-fix PRs.

## 6. Cross-references

- RFC-006 (ticketing + bidirectional sync), RFC-007 (scan coverage), RFC-008
  (shift-left CI). Architecture docs under `docs/architecture/`.

  ship.
