# Security lint — catches "primitive built, but not mounted" regressions.
#
# The audit kept finding the same class of bug: a defence primitive
# existed in pkg/* but the business code still used a vulnerable
# pattern directly (&http.Client{} outside pkg/httpsec, etc.). Once
# fixed, we do not want someone to reintroduce the bad pattern in a
# follow-up PR without noticing. This script runs in CI and fails the
# build on any regression.
#
# The rules are deliberately conservative: the audit lists every
# allow-listed exception below. If you genuinely need a new
# exception, edit this script in the same PR so the reviewer sees it.
#
# Rules 1, 4 and 6 read sibling repositories (agent/, sdk-go/), so the script
# expects a workspace laid out as <root>/{api,agent,sdk-go}. Point SECLINT_ROOT
# at that workspace when the script is not being run from inside it — CI checks
# the three repositories out side by side and does exactly that.
#
# SECLINT_STRICT=1 turns a missing sibling into a failure instead of a warning.
# CI must set it. Without it a workspace holding only api/ runs 4 of 6 rules,
# prints warnings nobody reads, and exits 0 — a green check that verified two
# thirds of what it claims. That failure mode is the reason this gate spent its
# whole life in a repository that does not exist on GitHub.
#
# Exit codes: 0 pass, 1 at least one rule failed, 2 script-usage bug.
