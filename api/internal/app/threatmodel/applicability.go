// Package threatmodel implements the continuous threat-modeling generation
// engine: it resolves a scope's crown-jewel / critical targets, walks the
// exposure-chain graph per attacker profile, and enumerates the applicable
// ATT&CK techniques per hop with a live-derived status (open / mitigated /
// covered / accepted / theoretical). The applicability and status logic are
// pure and IO-free (this file + status.go); service.go orchestrates the IO.
//
// See docs/rfcs/RFC-continuous-threat-modeling.md.
