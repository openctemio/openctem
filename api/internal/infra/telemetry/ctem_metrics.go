// Package telemetry exposes Prometheus metrics for every CTEM stage so
// the loop-closure SLOs in have real numbers to alert on.
//
// (invariant O1): one counter-in, one counter-out, one latency
// histogram per CTEM stage. Labels are tightly restricted to keep
// cardinality bounded: no tenant_id (RFC-046 B9: per-tenant views come from
// logs and traces, never from metric labels), and priority/severity are NOT
// labels on the latency histogram (their cardinality is covered by the
// counters).
//
// This package only DEFINES metrics — instrumentation sites live in
// the app and handler layers and call the Observe* helpers. That
// separation keeps the metric contract in one file so a CTEM reviewer
// can audit the whole maturity surface here.
