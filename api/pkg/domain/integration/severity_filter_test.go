// a human; if it reaches nobody the finding stays blocked indefinitely."

// The enqueue site stamps Severity: "medium" (vulnerability_service.go), and
// IsSeverityEnabled treats an empty enabled_severities list as critical+high.
// So the event-type gate was opened on purpose and the severity gate closed it
// again — the exact outcome that comment exists to prevent.

// These tests pin the two halves together so the same defeat cannot reappear.
