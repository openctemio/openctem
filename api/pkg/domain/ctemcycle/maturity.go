// CTEM-program maturity, made TRANSPARENT.
//
// A single "maturity score" is close to useless if an operator cannot
// see WHY it is what it is. So instead of an opaque number we return a
// breakdown: each component carries its raw metric value, a normalized
// 0–100 sub-score, its (effective) weight, and the resulting
// contribution. The composite is just the sum of contributions —
// reproducible by hand.
//
// The score must reflect only MEASURED signal. Each component declares a
// base weight, but a component is folded in only when it actually has an
// input to measure; the ACTIVE base weights are then renormalized to sum
// to 1.0 so the composite stays on a 0–100 scale. A component that is
// currently unscorable is still REPORTED (for transparency) but with an
// effective weight of 0, so it contributes nothing:
//
//	base weights   validation_coverage   0.30  // are fixes proven?
//	               resolution_throughput 0.25  // resolved / opened
//	               mttr_trend            0.20  // is MTTR improving?
//	               priority_stability    0.15  // low P-class churn
//	               scope_stability       0.10  // low scope drift
//
// When every component is active the effective weights are base/0.90 —
// e.g. a fully-scored tenant weights validation_coverage 0.30/0.90.
// scope_stability's drift source is deferred (always 0), so it carries
// no measured signal and is permanently excluded from Score until that
// source is wired — otherwise it would hand every tenant a fixed +10.
// mttr_trend is excluded when there is no prior cycle to compare against,
// and priority_stability is excluded when no findings were opened (there
// is then no prioritization work to be "stable" about) — either would
// otherwise inflate an inactive tenant toward a hollow ~35.
//
// Only the metrics defined in review.go feed the score. CTEM stage
// coverage is reported ALONGSIDE (StageCoverage) as an explainability
// aid but is deliberately NOT folded into the weighted number, so the
// score means exactly one thing: the quality of the measured program.
//
// Weights are intentionally simple, visible and tunable — change a
// const, the breakdown re-explains itself.
